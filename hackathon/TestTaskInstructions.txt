# The comments are hints for the commands you will need to use

First Task
This task is to make sure everything is working
(and that you can follow our instructions!)

Step 1
Create a folder in terminal to store your work, replace 'myTeamDir' with your team name
# mkdir myTeamDir

Step 2
Create a New file in that directory (mac)
Remember to end your filename with .py!
# vim /myTeamDir/newTaskFile.py

Step 3
Copy the code from the GitHub TestTask to a new file
Go to https://github.com/codeinverness/AstroPi/tree/master/hackathon
Select 'TestTask.py'
Click 'Raw' in top right corner
Copy text from file
Paste into a new local file

Step 4
Edit TestTask.py on your local machine so it says 'Hello, YourTeam!'

Step 5
Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

To test the code you write you will need to run it on the Raspberry Pi,
do do this you need to use a terminal command.

This copies from your local machine to the Raspberry Pi
# scp /myTeamDir/newTaskFile.py pi@<ip>:myTeamName/

Connect to the Raspberry Pi
# ssh pi@<IP>

Run code
# python3 myTeamDir/newTaskFile.py

Disconnect from pi
# ~.

Did the code complete the task?
- Yes?  Well Done! put your team name on the task paper and place it in the Amber section of the board.  'Drop the file into the dropbox!'
- No?  That's good testing!  Go back to your local file and make some changes to try again, keep on keeping on :)

remember you can go back and check the documentation and task hints any time
