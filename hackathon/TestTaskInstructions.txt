# The comments are hints for the commands you will need to use

First Task
This task is to make sure everything is working
(and that you can follow our instructions!)

Step 1
Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

To test the code you write you will need to run it on the Raspberry Pi,
do do this you need to use a terminal command.

# ssh pi@<IP>

Step 2
Create a folder in to store your work, replace 'myTeamDir' with your team name
# mkdir myTeamDir

Move into that folder
# cd myTeamDir

Step 3
Create a New file in that directory
Remember to end your filename with .py!
# nano newTaskFile.py

Step 4
Copy the code from the GitHub TestTask to a new file

- Open a browser on your computer
- Go to https://github.com/codeinverness/AstroPi/tree/master/hackathon
- Select 'TestTask.py'

Click 'Raw' in top right corner
Copy the text in the file

Step 5
Go back to the terminal
Paste the text from the TestTask.py file on the browser into the new file that you created on the rasperry pi

Step 6
Edit TestTask.py on your local machine so it says 'Hello, YourTeam!'

Step 7
Run your code
# python3 newTaskFile.py

Step 8

Did the Sense Hat show your team name?
- Yes?  Well Done! Save your file by pressing CTRL + X, the 'Y' key and then enter.
  Go now a do the task 'Create a function'
  
- No, the code didn't work?  That's good testing!  Go back to your local file and make some changes to try again, 
  after a couple of attempts you can ask a mentor if you are struggling, keep on keeping on :)

# remember you can go back and check the documentation and task hints any time
