# The comments are hints for the commands you will need to use

First Task
This task is to make sure everything is working
(and that you can follow our instructions!)

Step 1
Create a folder in terminal to store your work, replace 'myTeamDir' with your team name
# mkdir myTeamDir

Step 2
Create a New file in that directory (mac)
Remember to end your filename with .py!
# vim /myTeamDir/newTaskFile.py

Step 3



Edit testTask.py on GitHub code to include your team name! (remember to remove the comments!)

# from sense_hat import SenseHat
# sense = SenseHat()
# sense.show_message("Hello world, Team 1 is ready! :)")

Step 4
Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

To test the code you write you will need to run it on the Raspberry Pi,
do do this you need to use a terminal command.

This copies from your local machine to the Raspberry Pi
# scp /myTeamDir/newTaskFile.py pi@<ip>:myTeamName/

Connect to the Raspberry Pi
# ssh pi@<IP>

Run code
# python3 myTeamDir/newTaskFile.py

Disconnect from pi
# ~.

Did the code complete the task?
- If yes put your team name on the task and place it in the Amber section of the board
- If no go back to your local file and make some changes to try again,
remember you can go back and check the documentation and task hints any time
